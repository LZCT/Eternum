# Game Structure
### 1. Controls
The player controls Aeon, the protagonist, through a side representation. The character can be freely controlled over the scenario, dodging obstacles and facing enemies of different types.

Each stage of the game refers to a different era of the world, starting in the Paleolithic period, passing through the Medieval Era and reaching the present time.

### 2. Life Points
The player has a total of three life points per stage that cannot be acquired during the level. A life point is reduced if the character is hit by an enemy. When losing a life point, the character continues normally where he left off, and can be attacked again, resulting in the loss of another life point. If the player loses all three life points, the game is over and a game over screen is displayed, returning to the start menu. Certain obstacles such as fire or lava cause an instant kill, resulting in game over.

### 3. Score
The game score is obtained by destroying enemies and picking up the collectibles available through the level. For each enemy defeated, the player receives 100 points. Each collectible obtained results in 25 points each. Scoring allows the player to complete the level several times, always seeking a higher score.

 The intention of the score is to allow the player to carry out the level in different ways, trying to face as many enemies as possible and collect as many items as possible to get a new high score.

# Levels

### 1. Paleolithic period

Initial phase of the game, where Aeon starts his journey after his first time travel caused by an error in the time machine. To represent the Paleolithic Period, the level has underground parts and practically all platforms are represented as earth, showing the simplicity of the period and the non-existent technology of it. To progress to the next phase, Aeon must find the portal created by the time machine's glitch, leading him to the next phase and consequently a new era.

### 2. Medieval Era

Middle phase of the game, Aeon now faces powerful medieval soldiers, the scenario practically consists of stones and fortresses and has a castle right at its entrance. To reach the last level, Aeon needs to reach the end of the castle and find another portal created by his time machine, which takes him back to the present and consequently to the final level.

### 3. Present

Last stage of the game, Aeon faces Adamastor, the villain. Unlike the other stages, this level consists of a single platform to face the boss. The player must advance while forcing the boss to miss the hits. After a number of hits, the robot stops and rests, allowing the player to hit it and consequently defeat it when its health reaches zero. If the player takes too long to defeat him, the player will end up burning to death.
